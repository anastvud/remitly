Hello! Thank you for the nice task.

This task is written in Python and could be run on any OS. However, there is source.sh script which can be used on Linux machines. To run it you need to *source source.sh* and then you can choose what do you want to run. There is *main* with an example that was given in a task description or *tests* with some tests int it.
In directory *resources* there are some .sjon files for the tests.
